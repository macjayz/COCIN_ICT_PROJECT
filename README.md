Certainly! Here's a README.md format for setting up and running the Employee Management System application:

# Employee Management System

This is a RESTful API for an Employee Management System built using Java and the Spring Boot framework.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later: [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- MySQL: [Download MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the project from the repository.

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Configure the MySQL database:
   - Open MySQL Workbench or any other MySQL client tool.
   - Create a new database named "employee_management".
   - Update the database connection configuration in the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory. Set the correct username and password for your MySQL installation.

4. Build and run the application:
   - Build the project using the IDE or by running the following command in the project's root directory:
     ```
     ./mvnw clean install        (for Mac/Linux)
     mvnw.cmd clean install      (for Windows)
     ```
   - Once the build is successful, run the application using the IDE or by executing the following command:
     ```
     ./mvnw spring-boot:run      (for Mac/Linux)
     mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run    (for Windows)
     ```

5. The application should start, and you can access the API endpoints using a tool like cURL, Postman, or any web browser.

6. The API is available at `http://localhost:8080`.
